# C Programming Language

The C programming language is a low-level language used in embedded systems and operating system design and/or development. It is a very useful language that allows for the development of lightweight programs that can be run in all systems, hence providing portability to programmers.
It's syntax is a bit daunting if this is your first language. It is said that in C you have to do everything by yourself...from declaring datatypes to memory allocation and even how to access data stored in memory.

This repository contains various projects that teach significant concepts in the C programming language as part of training in the ALX SE program.

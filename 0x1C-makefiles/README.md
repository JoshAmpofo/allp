# Makefiles

Makefiles are a handy automation tool that allow developers to compile and run their programs more efficiently.
The `make` utility requires a file usually named `Makefile` or `makefile` which defines set of tasks to be executed.
Basically you can perfrom shell-like operations on your compiled programs using a makefile.
